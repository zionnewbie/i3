# i3
config,theme,fonts,polybar,rofi of my i3 WM

# This is Just some work of newbie in customizing linux( Rising as per other call it but mines not on that level to call a rise) 

# Anyways just headsup  this might break something  or not ,if it where to break "I AM ALSO CLUELESS"

## Ubuntu "sudo apt install " these :-
--rofi
--compton
--nitrogen
--polybar
--arandr
--playerctl 

<!-- these are the tools i used for this rice ,it's not perfect as this is my first WM rice 

some are taken from other's like the polybar was taken then modified for my needs 

wallapaer's are from other's too  -->

-disabled i3status
-setup nitrogen and compton to run when logged in or at start
-setup rofi as an alternative for dmenu , customixed the theme of rofi 
-used arander to make a disply output command for xrandr and made it execute when refresh or start
-NotoSans font
